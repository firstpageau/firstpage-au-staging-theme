                                <p>You can start with these three simple steps for SEO in Hobart:</p>
                                
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">1. Backlinks</p>
                                <p>Backlinks, as the name suggests, are links to your website that are placed on other websites. It is more complex than linking your website to any website on the internet.</p>
                                <p>Our SEO services in Hobart concentrate our efforts on finding reputable sources and creating valuable content. We know how to tackle backlinks and make your website more legitimate and strong online.</p>
                                 
                                 <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">2. Keyword research</p>
                                 <p>Keyword research is the process of finding the most relevant words that people use to search a topic on search engines. The results are all based on how relevant the search engine bots think websites are related to the query.</p>
                                 <p>The more relevant, the higher you rank.</p>
                                 <p>When doing your keyword research, start by listing topics that you think are relevant to your customer's searches. Then look at how your competition is ranking for those keywords. Once validated, use them in your website copy, title and URLs.</p>
                                 <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">3. On-Page SEO</p>
                                 <p>On-Page SEO helps make your site more relevant to both your customer and search engines. It consists of optimising your website for both search engines and your ideal audience.</p>
                                 <p>To start with on-page SEO:</p>

                                <p>Of course, you can. But do you want to spend so much time building a website? Going through intricate details and taking on all the technical work by yourself?</p>
                                <p>You can opt for building a team for SEO in Hobart - but you'll have to hire the right people, which takes time, and you'll have to pay them, which means a separate budget. You will also have to provide wages, sick leave, holidays, provision of software and technology.</p>
                                <p>You may think this will be cheaper, but this tends not to be true. </p>
                                <p>Simply put: You are more likely to waste precious time and money. It will take time for your newly formed team to master the SEO process, build a strategy, and start to get things running.</p>

                                <p>The cost of SEO in Hobart depends on several factors, such as:</p>
                                <p><b>Budget: </b>SEO costs depend on how much work is needed to bring your website to the top. Your goals, competitors, industry and keywords, are all taken into consideration. We can work around a specific budget, depending on what you require.</p>
                                <p><b>Requested outcome: </b>The cost of SEO varies depending on what you want to achieve. Bigger impacts require more significant investments.</p>
                                <p>Our SEO services in Hobart are tailored to match your goals and budget.</p>
                                <p><b>Experience: </b>The level of expertise of the team working on your business is related to the costs of your campaign. Our prices are set according to the needs of your business. We make sure that everything is taken into consideration. Our SEO experts in Hobart know the industry like the backs of their hands, and they deliver.</p>
                                <p>Be careful of cheap SEO services in Hobart. You will get results that are really not up to the mark. SEO has the best results when done right.</p>
                                <p>If you're willing to invest in a good SEO experience, choose a result-driven and reputable partner—choose First Page as your SEO company in Hobart.</p>
                                <p><b>Black-hat vs. white-hat: </b>Black-Hat SEO in Hobart will get you quick results, but it isn't the most legal way to go about getting them. Indeed, it manipulates the search engine's algorithm to influence the results to your liking. Don't be fooled by achieving a large amount of traffic in a short amount of time. These results won't last long and will die out after the initial excitement wears off.</p>
                                <p>Using black-hat SEO can get you penalised by Google. It's only a question of time before your traffic goes flat.</p>
                                <p>White-hat SEO is the ethical and best option for SEO in Hobart. It focuses on visitors' experience of your website, and creates quality and valuable content that retains and converts your audience. Unlike black-hat SEO, the results with white-hat tactics take longer to show. But once they do, you'll be amazed by the constant growth and sales it brings to your business.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO in Hobart is cheaper than white-hat. However, you need to consider if you want to put your reputation at risk while striving for a more affordable option.</p>
                                <p>First Page's Hobart SEO will always support longer-lasting and ethical ways. We haven't become who we are with black-hat SEO. The price we quote you is based on your business-specific needs and growth ambition.</p>

                                <p>Pay-per-click (PPC) is a form of advertising which brings customers to your site through clicks from ads they see at the top of search engines. </p>
                                <p>PPC requires investment upfront. You pay for high targeted traffic to your website's page. The more people click, the more expensive it becomes.</p>
                                <p>Using a PPC strategy can bring a large amount of traffic to your website. It is best for specific pages or eCommerce shops. However, the results you obtain are not sustainable. Traffic will stop as soon as you decrease the investment or stop the campaign.</p>
                                <p>Search engine optimisation, on the contrary, brings in traffic on autopilot in evergreen. Results take time to show, but once they do, they will keep growing.</p>
                                <p>SEO in Hobart is all about organic (free) traffic and improving your website to offer the best online experience to your visitors. This process is a long one and takes more time to implement and carry out than Pay per Click - but once you reach the first page, your website will stay there for a very long period. SEO for Hobart businesses grows over time and makes your sales skyrocket.</p>
                                <p>Both PPC and SEO in Hobart work well together and provide great results in synergy. For more information on PPC and how it can work for you, click here.</p>

                                <p>A backlink is a link from one website to another. Search engines, like Google, use backlinks as a ranking signal of trustworthiness and noteworthiness.

                                <p>Black-hat SEO is an infamous way of manipulating Google’s algorithm. It brings websites traffic using practices that ignore Google guidelines.</p>
                                <p>They completely ignore your brand and your audience. It is a set of practices, such as linking your website to a large number of low reputability websites, keyword stuffing or spamming. They also add links that may take the user elsewhere and will add irrelevant details to your site.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO can – and probably will – make your website receive penalties from Google and have it removed entirely from search engines.</p>
                                <p>There is no denying it. White-hat SEO is the only right way to do SEO. It does not involve any manipulation and follows Google’s guidelines. White-hat practices consist of publishing authentic, relevant, and value-based content. The results take time to appear, but they are long-lasting and will reward your business sales for many years.</p>
                                <p>First Page only ever uses white-hat SEO. Our SEO services in Hobart only deliver high-yielding and effective results for our clients. </p>

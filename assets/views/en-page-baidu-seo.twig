                <h3>Understand Baidu and grow</h3>
              <p>Although your business might have previously experienced success with a targeted Google, Bing or Yahoo campaign, taking the same approach to attract customers using Baidu would be a mistake. Naturally, there are a myriad of norms brands need to abide by if they are going to successfully convert consumers, ranging from language and cultural nuances to customer habits and legal issues. With expert help from First Page Australia, we can accomplish your goals.</p>
                <p>As Baidu is based entirely around Chinese content, ensuring your brand communicates in a way that Chinese consumers understand is imperative to success. Although foreign content is crawled by Baiduâ€™s algorithms, with the vast majority of users based in China, this content typically ranks poorly. Luckily, our dedicated team can <a href="https://firstpage.com.au/seo-copywriting/">create Chinese language content</a> that dominates the SERP.</p>

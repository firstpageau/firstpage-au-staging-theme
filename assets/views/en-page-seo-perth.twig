                                <p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the process of making a website more visible on search engines, so it can be found by people who're searching for your products online.</p>
                                <p>In other words, SEO strengthens your website’s organic presence, without paid advertising, to get more leads and build your brand authority.</p>
                                <p>Professional SEO in Perth determines the most relevant, high-traffic key phrases that your potential customers will be searching for, and then strategically places them throughout the text on your website. </p>
                                <p>When people search using these keywords, search engine bots notice they're on your website, and show your website on the search engine results page (SERP).</p>
                                <p>It sounds quite simple, but effective Google SEO in Perth involves much more than keyword research. Seamless, intuitive user experiences are also taken into account. Is your site easy to navigate? How often do you upload quality content for your visitors? </p>

                                <p>You can. However, we would argue that this is not the best use of your time as a business owner. You might think that building your own team is cheaper than hiring an agency, but the opposite tends to be true. </p>
                                <p>You could build an in-house SEO team, but the resources involved are far more expensive than SEO Perth prices. Think about it: You’ll have to recruit and look for the right people, train them, and pay for their salaries and software. After all that, you never know if they know what they're talking about, or if they will stick around long enough to long-term results.</p>
                                <p>Yes, an agency needs to make profits, but their SEO Perth prices also take many costs on your behalf.</p>
                                <p>For example, they take care of all the software tools it takes to manage an SEO strategy. These tools alone can cost you thousands of dollars a month.</p>
                                <p>An agency already has all the tools it needs to get results. All you pay for is its expertise, deep market knowledge, and services.</p>

                                <p>SEO Perth prices vary depending on a multitude of factors including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Budget. We offer a tailored growth plan based on your goals and budget.</li>
                                    <li>Scope of work. SEO Perth prices depend on the work that is required and the objectives you want to achieve. It takes into account the competitiveness of your niche, the difficulties of a targeted keyword, and the business growth ambition.  </li>
                                    <li>Desired Results. Different results required different investments and strategies. Our SEO services in Perth are tailored to fit your business's needs. </li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>You get what you pay for. Be careful of cheap prices for SEO in Perth. SEO is way more complex than doing the basic keyword research. It requires deep knowledge of the industry, niche, market, competition, and a well-informed and tailored strategy. </p>
                                <p>Cheap SEO services in Perth means a low level of experience, being behind on the latest technical best practices, and only doing the bare minimum – after all, this is what you've paid for.</p>
                                <p>Making mistakes in your SEO can have a huge impact on your website and sales. Be careful of any SEO agency in Perth that advertises a set price list or checklist. Every business’s needs are different, and what works for one might not work for another.</p>
                                <p>SEO can be very lucrative for your business IF done right. Investing in the right partner is key to success – like First Page SEO SEO agency in Perth.</p>
                                <p>- Black-hat vs White-hat. </p>
                                <p>The cost of SEO varies based on which strategy you choose to go with. Black-hat SEO focuses on quick wins and relies on manipulating Google algorithms to increase traffic. This is a short-term tactic and is not sustainable. Results will dissipate over time, and you are at risk of getting a penalty if Google finds out what you are doing. </p>
                                <p>White-hat SEO, on the contrary, is a long-term approach that follows search engines guidelines and focuses on improving your customer experience. This is a long-term approach. Results take longer to show, but they are reliable and sustainable. It involves investing in content that generates results for the years to come.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO services in Perth are cheaper than white-hat. However, you must ask yourself if it's worth risking your website to be unlisted from search results.</p>
                                <p>Here at First Page, we are all about compliance and long-lasting results.</p>

                                <p>When using PPC, you are bidding against other competitors in the industry for ad placement in search engines when someone searches for a keyword related to your business. </p>
                                <p>PPC will bring you traffic and results quickly for the duration of the campaign. However, you have to invest upfront and the results aren't as sustainable as SEO.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, SEO in Perth is based on organic search. This means you don’t have to pay for traffic. It takes longer to implement and to generate results, but once you're ranking higher, you will stay there for a very long time.</p>
                                <p>An SEO agency in Perth can bring you evergreen traffic that will grow your business over time and boost your sales.</p>

                                <p>It is important to note that eCommerce SEO serves other objectives than local SEO in Perth.</p>
                                <p>Local SEO reaches customers in one specific area. It makes sure your business is seen by people who live nearby, and brings proximity between your business and local customers.

                                <p>eCommerce SEO in Perth is for people with an online shop, who want to have their products on the top shelf, independently of geographic location. For example, your Perth-based business may also need some Sydney SEO to target online customers from there.</p>
                                <p>eCommerce SEO focuses on your products by improving your brand headline, merchandise description, and product listings for peak visibility and higher rankings on Google. </p>
                                <p>It's all about attracting new potential customers to your online store to catapult your sales. From product page to checkout, your customers will have the best online shopping experience.</p>
                                <p>eCommerce SEO services in Perth works well when coupled with a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign. The combination of both organic and paid methods can positively increase your revenue!</p>

                                <p>Of course we do. Even better, our SEO Perth company knows that not all backlinks are the same.  </p>
                                <p>One backlink from a high-performing, relevant website is way more valuable than 100 low-quality backlinks. That is why our SEO Perth company only uses high-quality backlinks from reputable sources.</p>

                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Black hat SEO</span> focuses on quick wins and violates Google guidelines. It relies on manipulating the Google algorithm to boost traffic, while disregarding the customer experience. </p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO strategies include duplicating content, stuffing keywords, re-directing users to another site page, and linking your website to other non-relevant content.</p>
                                <p>Such tactics are detrimental to the health of your website. Results are not sustainable and you are at risk of getting a penalty if Google notices that you are using it. In fact, black-hat local SEO in Perth can lead your website to be completely unlisted from search results.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">White hat SEO</span> is the correct and ethical way to optimise a site with SEO. It follows search engines guidelines and the rules that have been established to do it the proper way. </p>
                                <p>White-hat SEO is not manipulative. It provides the audience with the best experience possible. Its strategies include publishing high-quality content, improving page loads time, and giving real value to your users. </p>
                                <p>This is a long-term approach that requires more work upfront. This means that results will take time, but they will have a lasting, positive and sustainable impact on your business. </p>

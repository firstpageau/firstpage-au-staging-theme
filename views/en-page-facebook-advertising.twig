				<p class="text-center text-md-left">Once upon a time, Google was the only worthwhile platform in the digital advertising space. But then Facebook came along, and nothing was ever the same.</p>

				<p class="text-center text-md-left">Over the past few years, Facebook Ads have taken over as the best channel for digital marketing and one of the most effective ways to grow a business.</p>

				<p class="text-center text-md-left">Why?</p>

				<p class="text-center text-md-left">Because Facebook ads are highly targeted, endlessly scalable, and (if you hire the right agency), they are extremely profitable.</p>

				<p class="text-center text-md-left">This means you can get your products and services in front of the people who are interested in and will actually buy your products, and then scale those ads across 2.8 BILLION monthly active users.</p>

				<p class="text-center text-md-left">There’s no denying it. Whether you are a local business or an Enterprise powerhouse, Facebook Ads are one of the most powerful ways to blow your competition out of the water.</p>

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>Facebook ads are paid messages shared on the social media network that connect businesses with their ideal customers. With literally billions of people using Facebook every day, the beauty of the platform is that every business can attract their target market no matter how niche their products and services are. Although Facebook ads are simple enough for anyone to start using, capturing customer attention over the competition is another problem altogether.
								</p>
								<p>Fortunately, a highly experienced Facebook advertising agency like First Page has the skills your business needs to achieve its targets. As we launch a powerful campaign with interest-based targeting to expand your reach and attract like-minded customers, our talented digital marketers also produce compelling copy and images that secure the attention of those who matter most. Alongside comprehensive performance tracking to help us fine-tune our campaign, First Page’s dynamic Facebook ads have delivered millions in profit for our clients.</p>

						</div>
						<div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer" id="collapse2" class="collapse">
							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
								<p>The Facebook Pixel is a short piece of code you can add to your website to measure the success of your advertising campaign. This helps businesses ensure their Facebook ads reach the right people, including those who have previously visited your product pages or completed specific actions on your website. By tailoring your advertising strategy to these Facebook users, your business will benefit from a higher conversion rate, a much-improved ROI and superior growth over the competition.</p>
								<p>So how does the Facebook Pixel work? It uses cookies to keep track of individual website visitors and enables you to use this data to improve your ad campaign. With the Facebook Pixel levelling up your understanding of audiences, conversions, targeting and optimisation, measuring your results is made wonderfully accessible. While it’s possible to create Facebook ads without the Pixel, you won’t have access to all the information that helps you generate the most profitable campaign.</p>

							<p>Facebook ads have become a core component of countless digital marketing campaigns because they are remarkably effective for businesses operating at every scale. While your campaign’s goals will have to align with the budget you have to spend, using Facebook advertising to grow your company’s reach and achieve your goals is within your grasp. No matter your audience, an expert agency like First Page can plan and execute a strategy that helps your business stand out against its competitors.</p>
							<p>When we start working on a new campaign, we put unparalleled effort into reaching consumers at every stage of the customer journey.

						<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
							<p>If your business is ready to invest in a Facebook paid ads campaign, having a way to measure your success is essential. Not only do you ensure that your money isn’t simply being flushed down the drain, but you better understand how your strategy is working towards your goals and delivering a solid return on ad spend (ROAS). Depending on the objectives you set for your campaign at the outset, some metrics may be more relevant than others.</p>
							<p>Impressions are one of the factors that brands look towards when measuring their results. This reports how many times your ad is displayed on a screen, helping to determine whether your paid ads are reaching enough people. If not, there might be a problem with how your campaign was created. For brands wanting to convert more high-value customers, generating a value-based Lookalike Audience campaign using lifetime value data is bound to deliver remarkable returns.</p>

						<p>Facebook ads have become insanely popular amongst businesses globally due to the wide variety of advertising formats available. With each one helping your business achieve a different goal – from increased brand awareness to enhanced conversions – making sure your company chooses the ideal Facebook ad format for its needs is critical to your success. Our experienced Facebook advertising agency understands the nuances of each ad format, ensuring our strategies deliver the top ROI for our clients.</p>

						<p>If your business is looking to showcase the advantages of its goods, focusing your campaign around Product Ads, Slideshow Ads, and Collections Ads is an excellent choice. However, you can kickstart your lead generation campaigns with other formats such as Facebook Lead Form Ads, Dynamic Ads and Messenger Ads.

					<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
						<p>Facebook ads and Google ads are the two most common paid online advertising avenues for businesses operating today. While a personalised campaign for either platform will deliver outstanding results, several distinct features might leave one option more suitable than the other. For example, a detailed Lookalike Ads campaign on Facebook ensures your business reaches a vast audience of like-minded people who have a high chance of being interested in your exact products and services.</p>
						<p>However, people conducting searches on Google are more likely further along their buyer journey and might be more ready to convert than users scrolling through their Facebook feed. This can be beneficial to brands with short-term goals. With both platforms offering first-class reach and targeting options, the experts at First Page can ensure you achieve your objectives with a carefully tailored campaign. Whether your budget is big or small, we have the power to attract your customers with a message that converts.</p>

						<p>While you can create Facebook ads without a Facebook Business Page, you must have a standard Facebook account to get started. This doesn’t mean your ads will be tied to your account, as you simply need a profile to gain access to the platform’s advertising features.

Therefore, creating a Facebook Business Page will help reach your customers and generate sales when paired with a razor-sharp digital marketing strategy.</p>
						<p>While most of your competitors will already have Facebook Business Pages, you can implement a range of optimisations to catch up quickly. Always input your full business details, including a detailed description, to ensure your customers can get in contact. Meanwhile, you should add an action button to reach your goals faster, whether that means increasing followers, generating leads or helping customers book appointments.

							<p>Many forms of digital marketing use A/B testing to experiment with different versions of their campaign, helping businesses find the right combination of factors that resonate most with their target audience. Facebook advertising is no different, with the platform featuring built-in features to change numerous variables within your campaign. The first thing you need to do is define your test with measurable targets. Next, set up a test environment where you can easily analyse how each version of your ad performs.

							<p>To keep things simple, it’s a good idea to only test one variable at a time. This will help you clearly assess why one version of your advertisement performed better than another. In addition, you must define the sample size needed and the time frame required to ensure you collect enough data to draw accurate conclusions. With the help of our expert team, we ensure your Facebook advertising A/B testing maximises your budget.</p>

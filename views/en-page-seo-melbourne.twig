                                <p>We get this question a lot. Here are three ways to start with SEO in Melbourne:</p>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">1. Keyword research</p>
                                <p>Keyword research is usually undertaken by SEO consultants for Melbourne businesses. They'll identify the words and phrases that your target audience is looking for at high frequency, to incorporate them into your website copy.</p>
                                <p>If you're new to keyword research:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Make a list of relevant words your audience is using to search for your products.</li>
                                    <li>Use Google trends to evaluate which ones are being searched for the most.</li>
                                    <li>Use the most relevant ones 3 to 5 times throughout your website copy.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">2. On-Page SEO</p>
                                <p>On-page SEO is the process of improving a user’s experience on your website and optimising it for search engine bots.</p>
                                <p>When doing on-page SEO in Melbourne, you want to look at the back and front end of your website to attract more customers.</p>
                                <p>Here are our tips to start on-page SEO:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Look at your overall website (structure, findability, user experience).</li>
                                    <li>Write down the objective of each page.</li>
                                    <li>Includes keywords in URLs, page titles, and meta descriptions.</li>
                                    <li>Optimise your visual content.</li>
                                    <li>Add internal and external links.</li>
                                </ol>                        
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">3. Backlinks</p>
                                <p>Backlinks are links to your website, from other websites. Search engines bots see them as proof of the relevance and authority of your website, and rank your website higher for it.</p>
                                <p>To have your website link on other websites, you must have relevant content that brings value.</p>
                                <p>Our SEO consultants in Melbourne use backlinks to build your online authority and improve your ranking.</p>

                                <p>The cost of SEO in Melbourne depends on various factors:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Budget. Different budgets allow different service combinations. We tailor your growth plan to your specific business needs. We offer affordable SEO in Melbourne that fits what you can afford.</li>
                                    <li>Area of consideration. The cost of SEO in Melbourne depends on where you are starting from, the shape of your website, and the level of change you're looking to implement.</li>
                                    <li>Goals. The investment differs depending on the growth ambition and the time allocated to achieve it.</li>
                                    <li>Expertise. The Melbourne SEO consultants you choose to work with - their depth of expertise and level of involvement - is critical.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Our SEO services in Melbourne are tailored by a deep understanding across SEO, your business niche and growth plans, competition and industry. No one business is the same, and what works for one might not work for another.</p>
                                <p>Cheap SEO management in Melbourne means doing the bare minimum from a low level of capacity - especially solo contractors.</p>
                                <p>SEO for Melbourne businesses can make or break, so it's key to get it right.</p>
                                <p>A successfully implemented SEO strategy will reward you with traffic and sales on autopilot, for the years to come.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, making mistakes in your SEO can lead your business to be penalised and negatively impact your sales.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat vs white-hat. Most cheap SEO consultants in Melbourne, especially if they propose an attractive fixed set of pricing, use black-hat SEO.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Black-hat</span> SEO requires less work and relies on manipulating search engines. It goes against Google's guidelines and can get you banned from search engines. It also delivers a terrible customer experience for your web users. Results are quick, but neither qualified nor sustainable.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">White-hat</span> SEO respects Google's guidelines and focuses on providing value to your website visitors. It is a long-term approach that requires more work upfront. However, this work pays off, with an incredible boost to sales and a ranking on page one - for years to come.</p>
                                <p>When looking at the cost of SEO in Melbourne, take into account the reputation and credibility of the agency in question. The SEO practices they use to bring you results have deep implications for the success of your website and business.</p>
                                <p>First Page's SEO services in Melbourne brings our clients insane ROI. We help you become a leader in your field ethically, by following the rules.</p>

                                <p>eCommerce and local SEO in Melbourne aren't quick processes. It requires a decent amount of strategic work upfront, and it takes time for search engines to detect the changes.</p>

                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">White-hat SEO</span> uses SEO tactics in line with Google's guidelines. It's the right and best way to do SEO in Melbourne. It consists of improving the user experience and delivering value for your customers.</p>
                                <p>This is a long-term approach that brings sustainable results for your business growth. As you're gaining authority online and ranking higher on search engines, you'll start to reap the rewards in traffic and sales.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Black-hat SEO</span>, on the contrary, is the unethical way of doing SEO in Melbourne. It manipulates search engines to achieve short-term gains. </p>
                                <p>These tactics include keyword stuffing or linking your website to many low-quality, irrelevant websites to pretend you have authority online – rather than building authority for real.</p>
                                <p>Google is very good at detecting any form of black-hat SEO in Melbourne. It works actively to penalise the websites that use them.</p>
                                <p>If you want your business to grow consistently without risking all that you've built, we advise you to stay away from any black-hat SEO consultants in Melbourne. Do you seriously want your business to be associated with such practices?</p>
                                <p>Here at First Page, we're a reputable and well-known agency. And our SEO consultants in Melbourne haven't gained our reputation from black-hat SEO.</p>
                                <p>Our work is ethical, effective, and brings our clients incredible returns on investment.</p>

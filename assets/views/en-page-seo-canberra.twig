                                <p>You can start with your SEO in Canberra in 3 ways:</p>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">1. Backlinks</p>
                                <p>This technique aims to boost your authority online, by linking your website to another relevant website.</p>
                                <p>A backlink is similar to a digital vote. As your SEO company in Canberra, we understand that not every backlink is created equal. Quality counts more than quantity in this game.</p>
                               
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">2. Research on keywords</p>
                                <p>Keyword analysis means to identify the search terms your target customers are using to find the information they need, in search engines. </p>
                                <p>Search engines display website results, based on how relevant they are to the users' search query.</p>
                                <p>To begin with keyword research for your SEO in Canberra, follow these steps:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Consider which topics are relevant to your audience</li>
                                    <li>See where your competitors rank for the keywords you are targeting</li>
                                    <li>Your copy should include these phrases three to five times</li>
                                </ul>
                              
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">3. On-Page SEO</p>
                                <p>Optimising your on-page SEO makes the site more visible to both visitors and search engine bots.</p>
                                <p>An effective strategy for SEO in Canberra involves tweaking front- and back-end aspects, to increase the website's ranking on search engines.</p>
                                <p>On-page SEO in Canberra can be achieved by following these steps:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Review your website's SEO in detail</li>
                                    <li>Don't forget to include keywords in URLs, page titles, and meta descriptions</li>
                                    <li>Outline clearly what each page offers</li>
                                    <li>Add descriptive meta tags, titles, and/or meta descriptions to your pages and optimise them</li>
                                    <li>Add external and internal links</li>
                                    <li>Enhance content with visual elements and use <a href="{{home_url}}video-seo/">videos</a></li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>It's possible to be your own SEO agency in Canberra. However, it's a poor use of your time as a business owner.</p>
                            <p>While it's possible to build an in-house team for your SEO in Canberra, the cost of doing so and the time it takes are far more than relying on an SEO company in Canberra.</p>
                            <p>To hire the right person, you have to recruit and search. It's actually more cost-effective to hire an SEO company in Canberra, than to build your own team.</p>
                            <p>It is true that agencies need to earn profits, but they also bear many expenses for you.</p>
                            <p>An SEO company in Canberra is responsible for managing all the software tools required to control an SEO campaign. You don't have to shell out extra for these tools.</p>
                            <p>A full-time team at your company will require you to pay wages, holidays, sick leave and provide equipment and software that an agency would provide.</p>
                            <p>In order to get results, SEO companies in Canberra already have all the tools they need. There is no need to pay for anything but their expertise, deep market knowledge, and their various services - which will extend beyond SEO.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the costs, time is another important factor to consider.  When you have recruited and trained your team, they can't start implementing anything until they build a strategy.</p>
                            <p>Working with an established SEO company in Canberra, you'll have access to experienced professionals who will start the work right away.</p>

                                <p>In addition to the factors listed below, the costs of SEO in Canberra vary according to:</p>
                                <p><strong>Budget.</strong> Our custom growth strategies are based on your expectations and monetary constraints.</p>
                                <p><strong>Scope of the project.</strong> The costs of SEO in Canberra are based on the extent of work needed and the results you expect. This includes the difficulty of the targeted keyword, the competitiveness of your niche, and your business expansion ambition.  </p>
                                <p><strong>Expected outcomes.</strong> Investing and strategising differently produces different results. With our SEO company in Canberra, our business plan is tailored to meet your needs.</p>
                                <p><strong>Expertise and commitment.</strong> The price you pay is the quality you get. Cheap SEO in Canberra should be avoided!</p>
                                <p>Basic keyword research and executing the fundamentals of SEO in Canberra are not enough to optimise your website.</p>
                                <p>A well-informed and tailored strategy takes into account your industry, market, competition and business plans.</p>
                                <p>Providers of low-cost SEO in Canberra offer a low quality of service. They aren't up-to-date on industry trends and will deliver the bare minimum. Your website and sales may suffer from errors in your SEO. </p>
                                <p>If an SEO company in Canberra advertises a checklist or a set price list, beware. What works for one business may not work for another depending on the business's specific needs.</p>
                                <p>SEO for Canberra businesses can be a huge benefit, if you do it properly. The key to success is choosing the right partner - that's First Page as your SEO company in Canberra.</p>
                                <p><strong>Black-hat vs. white-hat.</strong> Your SEO strategy will determine the cost.</p>
                                <p>The focus of black-hat SEO in Canberra is to gain quick wins and manipulate Google’s algorithm to get more leads.</p>
                                <p>In the long run, this tactic is unsustainable. Google may penalise you if it discovers you're using it, and any outcomes will dissipate eventually.</p>
                                <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, white-hat SEO in Canberra follows search engine guidelines and improves customer experience over the long term.</p>
                                <p>Taking the long-term perspective, this is the best course of action.</p>
                                <p>There is a delay in seeing results, but they are dependable and sustainable. In order to do this, companies have to invest in content that will bring results for many years to come.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO is indeed cheaper than white-hat - but you need to ask yourself whether the savings are worth the risk of your site being delisted.</p>
                                <p>Compliance and longevity of results are the foundations of the success behind our SEO company in Canberra.</p>

                                <p><a href="{{home_url}}google-ads/">PPC</a> refers to a marketing model in which you are charged when an ad is clicked on. To put it another way, you are purchasing website visitors.</p>
                                <p>As a PPC advertiser, when someone searches for keywords related to your business, you are competing against other companies in the industry for better placement of your ads in search engines.</p>
                                <p>Traffic and results can be obtained very quickly and easily with PPC. While PPC may require upfront investments, it is not as sustainable as SEO since its results dissipate over time.</p>
                                <p>Unlike PPC, SEO relies on organic search, which means no money is involved in boosting traffic.</p>
                                <p>Implementing it and generating results takes longer, but your ranking will remain for a longer period once the results have been obtained.</p>
                                <p>Increasing your SEO rankings over time can help your business grow and drive sales.</p>

                                <p>Our Canberra SEO company knows that not all backlinks are created equal. The value of one high-quality and relevant backlink is much greater than the value of 100 low-quality ones.</p>

                                <p>SEO practices that violate Google guidelines are called black-hat SEO.</p>
                                <p>To increase leads, it manipulates Google algorithms without regard to user experience.</p>
                                <p>Some Canberra SEO companies use black-hat SEO tactics such as duplicating content, stuffing keywords, redirecting your users to another page, and linking to non-relevant websites.</p>
                                <p>Tactics like this are not sustainable over the long term. This marketing method does not work, and you are at risk of being penalised by Google if it finds out that you're using it.</p>
                                <p>Search engines may remove your website entirely if you use black-hat SEO methods.</p>
                                <p>When you optimise a site with SEO, you must use white-hat methods. </p>
                                <p>Firstly, it complies with the guidelines and rules of search engines. White-hat SEO does not manipulate search engine results. By doing this, we give the best experience that we can to our audience.</p>
                                <p>Using this method, you can create high-quality content, improve the loading time of pages, and provide value to users. </p>
                                <p>As a result, this is a more time-consuming long-term solution. The results will take time, but your business is guaranteed to be impacted in a positive, lasting and sustainable way.</p>
                                <p>Our Canberra SEO company is the #1 fastest-growing agency in APAC. We haven't achieved that by adopting black-hat SEO tactics.</p>
                                <p>The results we achieve for our clients are real, and they are long-lasting.</p>

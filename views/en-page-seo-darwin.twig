                                <p>Search Engine Optimisation, commonly called SEO, is optimising a website to improve its ranking on search engines and be seen by customers.</p>

                            <div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
                                <p>There are different ways to start with SEO in Darwin. Here is our suggestion:</p>
                                
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">1. Keyword research</p>
                                <p>Keyword research is the process of finding search terms that your ideal customer is looking for online and placing them on your website so search engines can see them. </p>
                                <p>The websites shown on Google's search page are based on the website’s relevancy with the user's query.</p>
                                <p>To get started with keyword's research:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>List topics that describe your products</li>
                                    <li>Regroup them in words that your audience is searching for</li>
                                    <li>Look at the frequency those keywords are being used</li>
                                    <li>Use them 3-5 times throughout your copy</li>
                                </ul>
                                 <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">2. Backlinks</p>
                                 <p>A backlink is a link from another website to yours. This link is seen as a digital vote by Google and increases your online authority.</p>
                                 <p>The higher the quality of the link, the higher you'll rank.</p>
                                 <p>Here at First Page, our SEO company in Darwin knows how important it is to prioritise quality over quantity.</p>
                                 <p>Your reputation can be built or destroyed with backlinks. Use them wisely.</p>
                                 <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">3. On-Page SEO</p>
                                 <p>On-page SEO optimises your website pages for visitors and search engine bots.</p>
                                 <p>It is the process of optimising your website page components to rank higher and attract more customers to your website.</p>
                                 <p>To get started with on-page SEO for a Darwin business:</p>
                                 <ol>
                                    <li>Review your website structure and content</li>
                                    <li>Include keywords in URLs, page titles, and meta descriptions</li>
                                    <li>Define clearly the value proposition for each page</li>

                                <p>You can do SEO in Darwin by yourself - depending on what type of results and ambition you have for your business.</p>
                                <p>Market leaders will work with an agency. And there is a reason for that.</p>
                                <p>You see, you might think that building a team or doing it on your own will be cost-effective. Reality shows that it is rarely the case. </p>
                                <p>The results you'll get with an agency can be 10 times your initial investment. You'll simply not achieve that by doing it alone or hiring a team.</p>
                                <p>An agency's sole objective is your growth, and they have an imperative to deliver.</p>
                                <p>With an in-house team, it depends on each of the individuals you chose to work with you, their experience, and knowledge of the industry.</p>
                                <p>You'll have to pay wages and a lot of costs associated. With an agency, you pay an all-in-one package and wait for the results to be delivered.</p>
                                <p>SEO in Darwin is very complex and competitive. And if you want to win, you have no choice but to get yourself on the first page of search engines.</p>
                                <p>An SEO company in Darwin will get you there faster and start working on your growth from the moment you hire them.</p>
                                <p>Here at First Page, your growth is our top priority. We are so sure that our techniques work that we offer <a href="{{home_url}}pay-on-performance/">pay-on-performance services</a>. This means we don't get paid until you're on the first page.</p>

                            <h3 itemprop="name">How much does SEO in Darwin cost?</h3>
                        </div>

                                <p>That's a question we hear a lot. The hard truth is that it depends on many factors:</p>
                                <p><b>Budget</b>. Depending on how much you're ready to invest, you'll have different services and plans. First Page is an SEO company in Darwin with tailored solutions to your needs and budget.</p>
                                <p><b>Goals</b>. The cost of SEO in Darwin depends on what exactly you're looking to achieve. A revision of your website won't have the same costs of an entire campaign leading you to the first page of Google.</p>
                                <p><b>Scope of work</b>. Depending on the work required to achieve your desired results, the cost will vary.</p>
                                <p><b>Expertise and charge of work</b>. The cost of SEO in Darwin depends on the expertise of the team you choose to work with. And rightly so. An agency with a proven track record, and over a decade of experience, won't cost the same as a contractor.</p>
                                <p>The results you get are equally correlated.</p>
                                <p>Be careful of cheap SEO companies in Darwin that offer you attractive prices but use dodgy practices such as black-hat SEO.</p>
                                <p>It is quick for them to implement but truly penalises your website in the long run.</p>
                                <p>Partner with an agency that knows how to outgrow your competition. That's the only way to succeed in the fast-changing and competitive world of SEO in Darwin.</p>
                                <p>Remember that when done well, SEO's ROI will bring you up to 10 times your investment.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat vs white-hat. The cost of SEO in Darwin varies based on which strategy you choose to go with.</p>
                                <p><b>Black-hat SEO</b> focuses on quick wins and relies on manipulating Google algorithms to increase leads.</p>
                                <p>This is not the right way to go. Results are an illusion and will dissipate quickly. You're also putting your business at risk of getting a penalty from Google.</p>
                                <p>This means no traffic at all.</p>
                                <p><b>White-hat SEO</b> is the SEO that follows the rules. It is a sustainable approach that creates authentic results and authority for your website.</p>
                                <p>Results take longer due to the work required to set it all up.</p>
                                <p>But once that is done, it will constantly grow and bring your business a large number of sales for years to come.</p>

                                <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. It brings traffic to your website organically by improving your website ranking on search engines.</p>
                                <p>You don't have to pay for traffic. Once it starts coming, it will continue for years to come, and your business will become an authority in your niche.</p>
                                <p>SEO in Darwin has enormous potential and an unmatched ROI.</p>
                                <p><a href="https://firstpage.com.au/google-ads/">PPC</a> or Pay-Per-Click is a marketing model in which you pay for traffic.</p>
                                <p>It consists of creating an ad and placing an auction for a specific keyword for your ads to appear at the top of your search results.</p>
                                <p>PPC brings traffic instantly. However, it only lasts for the duration of your campaign. It does not influence the organic ranking of your site. The more traffic you get, the more expensive it gets.</p>
                                <p>PPC requires an investment upfront. SEO does not.</p>
                                <p>SEO (organic Search Engine Optimisation) and PPC (paid traffic) complement each other in a campaign and accelerate your growth.</p>

                                <p>Backlinks are links to your website that are placed on another one. When website visitors click, they are redirected to your site. The more relevant and high-quality backlinks you get, the more qualified leads will visit your website.</p>
                                <p>Backlinks are an essential part of Google's algorithm and key to being on the first page. But, it is crucial to notice that not all backlinks are the same.</p>

                                <p>With SEO services in Darwin, there are two ways SEO is being done.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO is the way that violates Google guidelines to achieve quick and inconsistent wins. It relies on tricking Google’s algorithm to increase the number of leads and quickly dissipates over time.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat results are a dangerous illusion. If Google notices that you are using them, you will be penalised or, worse… completely banned from search engines.</p>
                                <p>White-hat SEO is the correct and ethical way to optimise a site - and that's true from Darwin to Hobart SEO. This is a long-term approach that generates positive, long-term, and sustainable results. Which directly impacts your business growth in a good way.</p>
                                <p>Put simply. It is how SEO services in Darwin should always be done.</p>
                                <p>White-hat SEO gives a lot of attention to the user experience and creates high-quality content—it is the way to build your reputation online. Results take longer to appear for the apparent reason that they are legit and sustainable, bringing you evergreen sales over time.</p>
                                <p>Here at First Page, we haven't become the number one agency to grow businesses by doing black-hat SEO. We focus on quality and only bring a large amount of sustainable traffic to our clients.</p>

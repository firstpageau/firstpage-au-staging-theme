                                <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. It consists of adjusting your website so it'll pop up in front of your target audience, when they are looking for information on search engines.</p>
                                <p>By enhancing your website features, SEO services in the Gold Coast provide a pathway to improve your online presence.</p>
                                <p>SEO also increases your reputation and influence, which brings about an influx of qualified leads.</p>
                                <p>One key SEO practice is finding the most relevant and popular key phrases that align with your potential customers' queries, so we can include them throughout your website.</p>
                                <p>That’s just the first step though. SEO in Gold Coast is tough to master. To be featured on the first page, your overall website experience and relevancy need to blow away all the competition.</p>
                                <p>Websites are assessed by search engine bots, and show up first if they are deemed the most relevant to solve users’ queries. </p>
                                <p>Our SEO services in Gold Coast take into account your website performance, the keywords used, how your competitors are faring, and how much authority you have online.</p>
                                <p>There are a number of simple questions to ask yourself if you are unsure about your site’s SEO, such as: Is your site easy to find? Do you know what your audience is searching for? How many times has your website been featured on other websites?</p>
                                <p>SEO in the Gold Coast takes into account your whole website and its online presence. When done according to the rules, it can bring about an immense number of sales and establish your business as a force to be reckoned with, in the industry you specialise in. </p>

                                <p>Keyword research is finding the words and phrases that your target customers use on search engines, and placing them throughout your website. This drives your website higher on the search engine results page (SERP).</p>
                                <p>Before spending time on keyword research, you need to make sure that you know your ideal customers super well. It's more than their age or gender! You need to step into their shoes and understand why they search for specific things.</p>
                                <p class="mb-1"><u>Here are three steps to master keyword research:</u></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Make a list of topics related to your business.</li>
                                    <li>Find keywords for each topic and classify them by relevance, authority and volume.</li>
                                    <li>Use them in your website's titles, descriptions and copy.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">2. On-Page SEO</p>
                                <p>On-Page or on-site SEO is a key part of SEO services for Gold Coast businesses. It focuses on all the elements of the web pages, to optimise the website’s search engine ranking and generate organic traffic.</p>
                                <p class="mb-1"><u>If you're new to on-page SEO, here's what to do:</u></p>
                                <ol >
                                    <li>Publish high-quality content on your website.</li>
                                    <li>Optimise all visual and <a href="{{ home_url }}video-seo/">video</a> content.</li>
                                    <li>Include keywords in your copy, titles and links.</li>
                                    <li>Make sure your website is mobile-friendly.</li>
                                    <li>Use links to your advantage.</li>
                
                                </ol>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">3. Backlinks</p>
                                <p>Backlinking is an off-page SEO technique. It consists of adding a link to your website on other web pages, to build your online reputation.</p>
                                <p>Never underestimate the importance of quality when it comes to backlinks! One link on a reputable website can earn you more traffic than 100 links on untrusted sites.</p>
                                <p>SEO in Gold Coast is complex. To prevent irreversible mistakes from happening, you need to partner with the experts at the top of the industry. And what better SEO company in Gold Coast, than First Page! </p>

                                <p>You absolutely can, but this will likely only work if you already have experience in digital marketing.</p>
                                <p>If an SEO company in Gold Coast will get you better results, the extra sales they drive will reduce your costs in the long term.</p>
                                <p>Ask yourself, Do you have the time to get an in-depth understanding of the technicalities of SEO? </p>
                                <p>If you're genuinely interested and it lights a fire inside you, that’s perfect. But if the reason is purely down to cost-saving, then it won't get you very far.</p>

                            <h3 itemprop="name">How much does SEO in Gold Coast cost?</h3>
                        </div>
                        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer" id="collapse17"

                            <div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
                                <p>Costs vary for SEO in the Gold Coast. Some of the factors that affect the final price tag are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Budget. Depending on how much you're willing to invest, you'll receive a different set of services. At First Page, we tailor our growth plan to fit your business needs and requirements.</li>
                                    <li>Scope of work. The costs of SEO in the Gold Coast vary, based on your goals and where you are starting from. The bigger the ambition and complexity, the more it will cost. </li>
                                    <li>Desired results. Different expected outcomes need different investments and methods.</li>
                                    <li>Expertise and involvement. With SEO in the Gold Coast, you get what you pay for. The best results are achieved by the professionals at the top of the industry.</li>
                    
                                </ul>
                                <p>Be careful of low-costs SEO agencies that offer a fixed set of prices. Your business is unique and needs a specific, tailor-made approach to succeed.</p>
                                <p>SEO services in Gold Coast can make or break a business - it all depends on how it's done. The best agencies pay for themselves through the results they drive. Agencies that charge more have a proven track record of successful projects and results. </p>
                                <p>- Black-hat vs white-hat SEO. Both are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. Black-hat SEO is cheaper than white-hat, and it risks your website being blacklisted on search engines. This means you will lose your online presence, sales and potentially go out of business.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Black-hat SEO</span> is a fast way of getting ranked, but it doesn’t adhere to Google's terms and conditions. It uses dodgy and illegal tactics. It's only a question of time before Google identifies the black-hat techniques and removes the website from the internet.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">White-hat SEO</span>  is the ethical way to do SEO in the Gold Coast. It follows Google’s rules and is based on good practices, such as providing valuable content and backlinks that are helpful to your audience. It's about quality work on a consistent basis.</p>
                                <p>Because it focuses on improving the customer experience, results take longer with white-hat SEO services in Gold Coast.</p>
                                <p>While cost reductions are an attractive prospect, don’t be fooled by the cheap upfront price. Ask yourself what kind of values you want your business to convey.</p>
                                <p>At First Page, we never use black-hat SEO. We offer white-hat SEO services in the Gold Coast, to deliver sustainable and incredible results to our clients.</p>

                                <p>SEO is organic, which means you don't have to pay for website visits. If this traffic drives leads and sales, it's like they were for free.</p>
                                <p>Results take longer than with <a href="{{ home_url }}google-ads/">Pay Per Click,</a> but it's worth the wait. Across digital marketing, the ROI on SEO for Gold Coast businesses remains unmatched, and the results you get from it increase over time.</p>
                                <p>This means that the sales you see at 3 months are lower than the ones you'll get at 6, 12, and 24 months down the line. </p>
                                <p>The best part about SEO in Gold Coast? It can become evergreen, and skyrocket your sales and business into the future.</p>
                                <p><a href="{{ home_url }}google-ads/">PPC</a> is a type of paid advertising in which you need to invest upfront. It's not organic like SEO. You pay for your ad to be placed at the top of the search engine results page (SERP), for specific keywords.  </p>
                                <p>Each time people click on your ads, you have to pay. In other words, the cost is proportional to the traffic you get. </p>
                                <p>PPC can drive quick results and will keep delivering for the duration of your campaign. It's great for new product launches and targeting specific audience types to come to your website.</p>

                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Black-hat SEO</span> does not respect Google’s guidelines and uses shady techniques. It is focused on quick results and disregards the user experience.</p>
                                <p>Some examples of black-hat SEO practices include duplicating content, page swapping, and invisible text.</p>
                                <p>This is the wrong way of doing SEO in Gold Coast. The results are an illusion and are not sustainable. Black-hat SEO puts your business at risk, as it can lead to your website being banned from search engines.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-weight-bold">White-hat SEO</span> respects and follows Google's guidelines, and is the correct way to increase your ranking.</p>
                                <p>It does not use quick-win tactics, as it instead focuses on providing users with a great and valuable website experience.</p>
                                <p>White-hat SEO uses tactics such as offering high-quality services, using descriptive keywords in the metadata, and fast page loading.</p>
                                <p>This is a long-term approach that takes time to yield results. White-hat SEO for Gold Coast businesses means long-lasting and sustainable results.</p>

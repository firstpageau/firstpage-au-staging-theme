                <p class="text-center text-md-left">In addition, the way people use Pinterest makes it particularly lucrative if your website or ecommerce brand has exceptional products to sell. For instance, 97% of the top Pinterest searches are unbranded. </p>
                <p class="text-center text-md-left">What does that mean? The customers your Pinterest Ads reach haven’t made up their minds on the products they want. Therefore, a compelling strategy that hits the ideal audience with the right message has a high chance of converting. </p>
                <p class="text-center text-md-left">As Pinterest users are interested in finding products for the future, users don’t find ads intrusive as long as they are relevant to their needs. With carefully planned Pinterest Ads for ecommerce, you have the power to convince millions of users that your products are what they need.</p>

                                <p>Pinterest search ads are super effective for countless businesses around the world. But like every social media marketing campaign, your pins must resonate with your target market to achieve your goals. That means you have to carefully define the demographics of your customer base, including age, gender, interest, income, location and more. </p>
                                <p>Next, you have to determine which type of Pinterest Ads makes sense for your goal. There are five different formats intended for specific objectives, including brand awareness, website traffic and conversions. Alongside visually stunning Pins and razor-sharp <a href="{{home_url}}seo/">SEO</a>, measuring your campaign’s performance also helps achieve striking results.</p>

That means you have to create stunning imagery in a vertical format to have the biggest impact. Meanwhile, a sharply written and SEO-friendly description helps boost the discoverability of your Pins dramatically. </p>

                                <p>There are five types of Pinterest search ads to consider:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Standard: </li>
                                    <p>Standard Pins allow brands to highlight their products with vertical and square images or videos. When users click on these pins, they are led directly to your website.</p>
                                    <li>Video:</li>
                                    <p>Video Pins run for 4 to 15 seconds in two different formats – Standard and Max Width. While the latter is the same size as a regular Pin, the former spreads across the feed to reduce the number of Pins from competitors.</p>
                                    <li>Shopping:</li>
                                    <p>Upload products directly from your Pinterest catalogue and drive conversions with Shopping Ads. As this format allows brands to add extra information like price, availability, condition and more, this might just convince someone to purchase.</p>
                                    <li>Carousel:</li>
                                    <p>Carousel Ads are a great way to showcase the best aspects of a single product or multiple products at the same time. As you can upload 2 to 5 images – each with a title, description and website link – increasing traffic is simple.</p>
                                    <li>Collections:</li>
                                    <p>Collections Ads feature a single main image and three secondary images, helping you highlight what's great about your product. You might use the hero image to highlight the product in use while letting the smaller images showcase its finer details.</p>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Pinterest and Instagram seem similar on the surface due to their highly visual nature, but the comparisons stop there. Instagram is designed to share your own content, while Pinterest is dedicated to exploring and saving what other people are fascinated by.</p>
                                <p>While getting potential customers to visit your website takes a huge amount of work on Instagram, Pinterest uses links as one of its main features.

                                    <p>Like every social media platform, Pinterest has advertising guidelines that must be followed if you want your campaign to get off the starting line. For example, there are numerous types of prohibited content that brands simply aren’t allowed to promote products for. Meanwhile, Pinterest also has guidelines around clickbait and misleading ads.</p>
                                    <p>The best way to ensure your Pinterest search ads don’t break any important rules is by working with First Page.

            <h2>Remarket your products to people who have previously visited your site to see a massive boost in sales</h2>
            <p>Google Display Ads are criminally underrated. </p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>Because few other ad platforms are so robust, so visual, and also offer powerful remarketing options the way that Google Display Ads do. </p>
            <p>These ads allow you to tell your brand’s story, and create a customer journey that is fully optimised for leads and conversions. </p>
            <p>The visual components of Google Display Ads are truly unique, and give you the ability to showcase your business around the world and transform random internet browsers into superfans of your brand. </p>
            <p>Whether you are looking to advertise on YouTube, Gmail, mobile apps, games, or specific types of websites - Google Display Ads will shock you with how targeted, and effective, they can be. </p>
            <p>Here are some shocking statistics about Google Display Ads network…</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Google Display Ads will be able to reach 90% of global internet users</li>
                <li>84% of marketers use display ads</li>
                <li>Google Display ads are most effective in the 25-44 age group</li>
                <li>You can cross-target, allowing you to create a more effective funnel and reach more potential buyers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of this makes it undeniable - Google Display Ads are a worthwhile investment for Ecommerce businesses, client-based businesses, and everything in between. </p>

                There are numerous ways to advertise using Google Ads, with
                Google Display being just one ad format that helps businesses
                reach and convert their target market. Based on the Google
                Display Network, which has the power to reach over two million
                websites and 90% of internet users, these highly visual ads can
                appear across everything from news websites and blogs to Gmail
                and YouTube. If your brand is looking to promote a wonderfully
                aesthetic product or service – like clothing, travel deals or
                adventure activities – display ads can capture unbelievable
                attention.
              </p>
              <p>
                Businesses using online advertising for the first time often get
                confused about the differences between search vs display ads.
                The key distinction is that search ads will only appear on the
                search engine results page, while display ads can appear in
                millions of locations around the internet. In addition, search
                ads only appear to users searching for a specific type of
                product, while display ads capture attention based on diverse
                targeting parameters. Alongside powerful remarketing campaigns,
                Google display ads can be hugely productive for brands operating
                at every scale.

                Google search ads and Google display ads have several
                significant differences that could make one option the better
                choice for your brand. This decision is largely based on your
                long-term goals, with a strong campaign looking to identify
                whether intent-driven vs awareness is the right way forward.
                With search advertising effective at reaching consumers further
                along the buyer journey, these ads are great for converting
                customers who want to buy shortly.
              </p>
              <p>
                While display advertising can also convert these customers, this
                format is ideal for generating brand awareness. This is because
                the highly visual nature allows you to showcase the aesthetic
                qualities of your products or services. With display advertising
                aimed at customers towards the top of the marketing funnel, this
                kind of advertising can push consumers towards making a purchase
                as they get to know your brand and its credentials. When
                deciding between search advertising and display advertising,
                consider the push vs pull intention that sets these ad formats
                apart.

                Online advertising has become critical for brands looking to
                reach their target market and generate sales. But with so much
                competition existing online, you need to ensure you develop an
                optimised campaign that achieves your goals. If your business
                wants to instantly get in front of your target market, Google
                display ads are a top-notch strategy as they can be carefully
                targeted to your precise customer base. By ensuring your ads
                appear when your audience hangs out online, you can drive more
                engagement with your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Google display ads are also particularly effective for brands
                that produce visual products that benefit from showcasing
                vibrant colours and dynamic imagery. By using photography and
                custom graphics to highlight how your clothes look on a model or
                the collaborative qualities of your software, you can build
                awareness and convince potential customers to take action.
                Meanwhile, Google Ads makes it easy to forecast the performance
                of your campaign, so you can keep close tabs on your success.

                Google Ads is divided into two networks known as the Google
                Search Network and the Google Display Network (GDN). The latter
                has a truly staggering reach for where your display advertising
                can appear around the internet. Featuring more than two million
                websites that reach an estimated 90% of all internet users, your
                display ads have the potential to reach your consumers on any
                one of these sites. This also includes hugely popular Google
                search sites, such as YouTube, Gmail and Google Finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you decide to launch a new Google display advertising
                campaign, the default ad format is responsive display ads. By
                uploading your advertisement in various sizes, this sees the GDN
                identify suitable spaces on websites around the internet that
                are visited by your customer base. Whether that’s a news website
                or a specific blogger, you can capture outstanding attention
                based on their interests. Meanwhile, the topic targeting feature
                sees the GDN expand your reach by placing ads on websites about
                related topics that your target market also cares about.

                If you’re thinking about starting a display advertising
                campaign, it won’t take long to realise the variety of targeting
                options that allow you to reach your target market. In-market
                targeting is highly effective for brands looking to reach
                consumers interested in a specific topic, such as fitness, real
                estate or fashion. You can also target your campaign based on
                placement targeting, which lets you identify certain websites
                that your ideal customers use frequently.
              </p>
              <p>
                By allowing the Google Display Network to target consumers based
                on related topics to your products and services, you can quickly
                expand your reach and attract fresh customers. Alongside these
                and several other methods, you can also use optimised targeting
                to focus your display advertising campaign on the right people.
                For instance, you can exclude specific categories and audience
                types to ensure your budget is only spent on people who have a
                distinct interest in your brand.

                There are two ways to upload Google display ads to the platform
                that requires different things from your brand. The first is
                where you upload your own ads and take full responsibility for
                the design specifications. While this can be effective for
                companies with specific goals, this limits your ability to
                advertise on some websites due to size restrictions. If you
                decide to go this route, you must produce ads in a range of
                shapes and sizes, with the most common including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Half-page or Large Skyscraper Ad: 300 x 600 pixels</li>
                <li>Medium Rectangle Ad: 300 x 250 pixels</li>
                <li>Large Mobile Banner: 320 x 100 pixels</li>
                <li>Leaderboard Ad: 728 x 90 pixels</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, brands can also make the most of Google’s simplified
                approach, known as responsive display ads. This is where Google
                Ads takes your business name, logo, visual imagery and ad copy
                to produce several versions of your advertisement for you. As
                these ads automatically respond to the varied requirements of
                websites across the internet, your ads will appear in far wider
                locations than the standard upload option.

                Starting a Google display advertising campaign is an exciting
                time, but you want to make sure you get everything organised
                correctly from the beginning. The first thing you have to do is
                select a goal for your campaign, ranging from sales and leads to
                website traffic. Then, you have to choose the ad format and
                decide which devices you want to show up on. Plus, brands can
                select a Google Smart Display Campaign to automate their
                targeting and bidding. However, it’s particularly important to
                identify the perfect target market from the outset of your
                strategy.
              </p>

              <p>
                This involves understanding the kind of people who care most
                about your products and services, including age, gender,
                location and interests. Your Google display ad bid strategy is
                also critical to your success, with several options intended for
                different campaign goals. After you create responsive display
                ads or upload your own, set up conversion tracking to receive
                insightful data on how consumers interact with your marketing.

                The cost of Google display ads will be different for every
                campaign, as there’s a myriad of factors that go into
                determining the best way to reach your target market. With
                customer demographics, different industries and keyword
                selection impacting how much a brand can expect to pay, the
                budget required to achieve your goals is constantly changing.
                However, Google display ads are consistently cost-effective,
                with the average cost-per-click estimated at less than $1.

                bid strategy selected. You may choose to bid based on cost per
                impression (CPM), which will help your brand generate awareness
                and grow its reputation. However, a cost-per-conversion strategy
                is optimised to achieve a certain number of sales for a specific
                target price. Alongside First Page's detailed PPC management
                services, we can help your business reach its objectives for an
                outstanding ROI.

                Although most display advertising campaigns are dedicated to
                achieving the most clicks possible, there are numerous other
                positive aspects to consider. This is where the impression
                reporting feature within the Google Display Network comes into
                play. By having the ability to measure the impact of unclicked
                display advertising, you can keep track of customers returning
                to your website after viewing an ad, even if that action doesn’t
                take place immediately. Before this feature was added, it was
                difficult to measure the influence that display advertising had
                on brand awareness.
              </p>
              <p>
                As some consumers might not convert for weeks, impression
                reporting informs you about how many of your display
                advertisements buyers have come across previously, even if they
                never clicked on one. This helps brands develop a deeper
                understanding of their display advertising performance across
                several online channels. With the Multi-Channel Funnels report
                highlighting these conversion paths within Google Analytics,
                this data will fill in the gaps about how conversions were
                achieved and what steps will enhance your sales funnel.

                Display advertising has the potential to be life-changing for
                your business. But you need to design effective display ads that
                communicate the unique qualities of your products and capitalise
                on the desires of your target market. If you’re ready to start
                creating your display ads, four key elements must be organised
                successfully, including company name, value proposition, visuals
                and a call-to-action button. These must be combined with
                eye-catching colours and sharp typography without leaving
                potential buyers confused. With the right approach, your
                carefully tailored creative will help drive your business goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alongside the design of your display ads, you must also focus on
                generating optimised landing pages that reflect the same
                message. With your advertising increasing brand awareness and
                consumer interest, you can push customers further along the
                buyer journey when they arrive on your landing page. By aligning
                your ad copy and including high-quality imagery, you can
                convince people to complete their purchase. Use the ability to
                A/B test various versions of your display ads to analyse which
                ones best achieve your objectives.

                Google display ads have become widespread across the internet,
                but they can still deliver exceptional results when targeted
                effectively. By having a detailed understanding of your customer
                base, you can drive brand awareness with display ads that
                respond to their needs and desires. Alongside cutting-edge
                techniques like dynamic creative to generate expressive brand
                stories and rich media that brings your ads to life, display
                advertising can deliver superior returns for your business.

              <p>
                A targeted Google Display campaign is also perfect for
                re-engaging consumers who care about your products and services.
                Even if they decide not to purchase immediately, you can use
                remarketing lists to reach out again and convince someone that
                you can provide what they need. Plus, brands can keep track of
                their impression reporting to see how their budget generates
                huge upsides outside of their click-through rate. Partner with a

                Google display ads are remarkably effective for e-commerce
                businesses. As you’re naturally looking for customers browsing
                for products online, this highly visual ad format can help you
                showcase the best aspects of your products and convince users to
                check out your business. By reaching your target market in
                relevant online locations, ranging from industry-specific news
                websites to YouTube videos, you can ensure you communicate the
                perfect message to the right people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Part of what makes Google display ads so rewarding is how they
                can be targeted at in-market audiences. This technique means you
                can attract consumers who are actively searching for a product
                or service that you offer. With the display advertising
                algorithm considering the actions of specific users, such as
                previous ads clicked, it can identify those who have the highest
                chance of caring about your message. By leveraging this system
                to your advantage, you can drive highly-qualified users straight
                to your online store.

                Every business wants to generate the best possible click-through
                rate (CTR), but it’s important to have realistic expectations
                when establishing a new campaign. The optimal CTR varies by
                industry significantly, with the average benchmark ranging
                between 0.4 - 1%. So what industries deliver a superior CTR? The
                likes of real estate and dating are considered some of the
                top-performing sectors, with the emotional ad copy at the heart
                of these activities helping to produce huge returns.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it’s possible to experience a CTR that rises above and
                beyond the competition with the right approach. Audience
                targeting is perhaps the most essential factor. By understanding
                your target market and knowing how to reach them, you can
                attract engaged consumers and convince them to click. Alongside
                top-notch creative that resonates with your customer base and
                the clever exclusion of certain topics and audiences, you can
                ensure your campaign only reaches the most engaged people.

                Many companies believe they have to choose between search and
                display ads when kickstarting their online advertising strategy.
                But the reality is that these two approaches can work in unison
                to ensure you’re capturing the greatest amount of attention and
                conversions from your target market. While search ads are
                excellent for gaining clicks from customers further down the
                marketing funnel, brands that use this advertising method alone
                aren’t reaching a significant chunk of their target market.

                However, display advertising based on the Google Display Network
                can appear on more than two million websites, including massive
                platforms like YouTube and Gmail. This means you can reach more
                potential customers in a wider variety of places around the
                internet. In fact, running search and display advertising
                simultaneously ensures your brand experiences the advantages of
                both campaigns, leading to a surge in website traffic and
                conversions from consumers at various stages of the buyer

                Google display advertisements start delivering brand awareness,

                performance of your campaign, over time, the algorithm will get
                to know your campaign and increase visibility as its quality and
                usefulness for users is confirmed.

While no one knows the exact parameters used to rank websites – except maybe Google – we know numerous ranking factors can be leveraged to drive massive growth. Finding and optimising the ideal combination of these ranking factors is how a team of experts will achieve your business objectives.
							</p>
							<p>With these factors including everything from keywords and content quality to detailed link building profiles, technical changes and local listings, we have the power to push your website up the results page. By creating a website and overall online presence that appeals to your customers and resonates with search engine algorithms, Google will start giving your business more attention than your rivals. Considering 75% of users never look beyond the first page of results, placing your business near the number one spot must be a top priority.</p>

						<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
							<p>Almost every comprehensive SEO campaign includes a technique known as
								<a href="{{home_url}}link-building/">link building</a>. This is where a business creates high-quality content around its products, services or industry to increase how many like-minded websites share this information with their own audiences. As more links to your website spread across the internet, your brand’s credibility grows, as does your customer base. Part of the reason link building is so vital to an effective SEO strategy is that Google perceives backlinks as validation of your website’s quality. With more websites linking to your content, the algorithm sees it as a signal that potential customers will find helpful information on your website.
							</p>
							<p>This endorsement is amazing for improving your position in the search engine rankings. Plus, it also boosts your authority amongst potential customers. Fortunately, there are many ways to start building your backlink profile. You can start a top-notch company blog, guest post on popular online publications, share infographics on social media or turn brand mentions into links to your website. With link building critical to every high-end search optimisation campaign, investing in this strategy pays incredible dividends.</p>

							<p>SEO sometimes requires a degree of patience when getting started. Whether you’re building a website from the ground up or breathing new life into an old one, putting the perfect systems in place is a long and continuous process that requires constant monitoring and adjustment. Meanwhile, factors such as seasonality, the age of your website and the number of referring domains can also influence the time needed. However, First Page Australia’s refined approach means we can take big strides immediately. Before we start making changes to your website, we’ll research everything there is to know about your business and its target market.
							</p>
							<p>As this vital information shapes our search engine optimisation strategy, getting this right from the beginning ensures we save you plenty of time, money and effort later in the process. After developing a comprehensive campaign – supported by precise keyword research, competitor analysis and fresh content – we’ll put our ideas in motion and skyrocket your website's search engine rankings. While it might take weeks or even months to see the full rewards, once our search optimisation campaign captures the attention of Google’s algorithm, this investment will become one of the driving forces behind your website’s conversions.</p>

							<p>While
								<a href="{{home_url}}seo/">SEO</a>
								and PPC (pay-per-click) are both remarkable digital marketing techniques, there are some clear distinctions about how these achieve your goals. Search engine optimisation is used to attract organic search traffic by ensuring your website appeals to search engine algorithms that push it up the rankings. While it might take some time, it’s possible to implement organic search techniques on your website for free. Alternatively,
								<a href="{{home_url}}google-ads/">PPC</a>
								campaigns involve paid online advertisements that appear in the search results. As it costs money to promote your business, you will need a budget that’s big enough to reach your target market and generate meaningful sales.</p>
							<p>However, you don’t have to wait around for your work to make an impact, with PPC campaigns displaying your ads to relevant customers from the moment you launch your strategy. Depending on the nature of your goals, it might make sense to choose SEO or PPC over the other. Yet many businesses find huge success from using these methods in conjunction with each other. For instance, PPC brings in immediate leads while SEO grows your website’s presence and authority long into the future.</p>

							<p>Content is king when it comes to high-quality SEO. Across keyword-driven landing pages, educational blog posts and a myriad of other content types, knowing how to reach and convert your target market makes a massive difference to your company’s bottom line. So what does great content look like? Drawing insight from Google’s E-A-T guidelines, you want to develop a tone of voice that resonates with your target market and ensure your content is highly readable. That means clear headings, simple fonts and no annoying ads. As Google wants their search product to deliver the best results for users, they are increasingly organising results based on content quality.
							</p>
							<p>Although this encompasses numerous factors, many studies have found that longer blogs of around 1,000 words consistently perform the best in search results. Meanwhile, this content must be completely unique, add appropriate internal and external links, and feature keywords that respond to search intent. Our search engine ranking specialists produce outstanding content that speaks your customers’ language.

						<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
							<p>SEO is constantly evolving. In the past, achieving a decent rank was made possible with the cynical stuffing of keywords alone. As search engines have become far more sophisticated, there’s a far greater emphasis on high-quality content that’s unique, keyword-driven and designed to be read by real people. In fact, Google calls this ranking factor E-A-T or Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness. By creating content that keeps users on your website for longer and provides solutions to their questions, search engine algorithms will grow to love your website.
							</p>
							<p>While the definition of quality is subjective, there are many ways we ensure your content production rises above and beyond the competition. A comprehensive search engine optimisation campaign focuses on user intent to attract the right target market to your website at the perfect moment. Effective search optimisation also means your website is fast and easy to navigate, while a talented specialist will analyse their results to fine-tune your campaign’s performance. This way, your website will quickly climb through the search engine ranks.</p>

							<p>The techniques required to deliver a successful SEO campaign are different for every business. Naturally, this means the cost can vary considerably too. For instance, some niches involve a much higher cost per keyword to attract the perfect target market. In other cases, a website’s search optimisation standards only require a refresh rather than a complete overhaul to achieve the client’s goals. When our highly respected digital marketing agency is approached by a potential client, we provide a detailed quote that ensures they fully understand the costs involved.

							<p>Whether that’s $500 or $5,000 per month, our search specialists conduct in-depth research into your website’s history, target market and industry complexities to ensure we only take actions that achieve your objectives. As we monitor the progress of your search engine ranking strategies and fine-tune our approach to deliver even better results, you can trust First Page Australia’s pricing models to provide your business with the biggest bang for its buck.</p>

A leading search optimisation agency with a well-rounded skill set will do everything in its power to ensure your website becomes visible to your largest and most relevant customer base.

							<p>Primarily, an SEO agency works closely with its clients to develop a campaign that appeals to their precise objectives and target market. Plus, they identify superior keywords, kickstart link building campaigns and make vital technical search engine optimisation changes, among dozens of other factors. With the right team by your side, it shouldn’t take long to see the positive impact of their work.

As search engines become more intuitive every day, implementing a cutting-edge search strategy solidifies your company's future.</p>
							<p>You might not control what your competitors are doing to grow their presence in the industry. But taking a comprehensive approach to search optimisation means you can have the greatest impact on how relevant customers discover your business and engage with it online. It doesn’t matter who your target market is. SEO can reach everyone from teenage impulse buyers to corporate decision-makers upgrading their company’s critical software.

While these employees might be talented in other aspects of marketing, search optimisation is its own field that requires an expert touch to experience top results.

By outsourcing your campaign to a dedicated digital marketing agency, you have the power to save yourself untold amounts of time, money and energy.

							<p>SEO is critical to your company’s digital marketing strategy, so you want to partner with the ideal agency. The first thing you want to do is determine the ultimate objective for your campaign. This will help you decide which agency has the skills to accomplish your aspirations. Then, find out what techniques an agency will use to get your website ranking. While most agencies operate ethically, some use underhanded ‘black hat’ methods to rank faster. This sounds appealing in premise, but Google will deindex your website if they see your website cheating the system.
							</p>
							<p>Alongside the skills to accomplish your goals, you want to work alongside an agency that frequently measures their success. This way, you can see how your budget is being used to benefit your business. While it’s tempting to go with the cheapest option on the market, the results will almost certainly fall below your expectations. This is because these agencies often send work overseas. Considering how important search engine optimisation is to your success, make sure your campaign is being handled by local specialists only. Do your homework and you can’t go wrong.</p>

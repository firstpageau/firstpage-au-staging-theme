                                <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimisation, is the process of making your website visible on search engines so that it can be found by your ideal audience organically and increase sales on autopilot.</p>
                                <p>In other words, when SEO for Geelong businesses is done correctly, it attracts organic traffic to your website and builds your brand credibility online.</p>
                                <p>SEO in Geelong is complex and has different components, but the most popular is keyword research.</p>

                                <p>When people search on Google, the most relevant websites pop up for the keywords they use. These are typically the sites that people click on.</p>
                                <p>SEO in Geelong is also about improving your overall website experience to make it mobile-friendly and enjoyable for visitors.</p>

                                <p>There are three ways you can start with SEO in Geelong:</p>
								<p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">1. Keyword research</p>
                                <p>Keyword research is the process of discovering words and phrases that people search for on search engines like Google and Bing.
                                </p>
                                <p>It impacts every other aspect of SEO in Geelong, as these keywords are the very foundation of your content creation, outreach, and on-page SEO.
                                </p>
                                <p>To start with keyword research, do the following:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li> Brainstorm a list of topics related to your products or services
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Use Google Keyword Planner to find keywords related to the topic
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Sprinkle them all over your website copy (we recommend 3 to 5 times)
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">2. On-Page SEO</p>
                                <p>On-page SEO consists of optimising your web page content for search engines and users. Some on-page SEO techniques are listed below: </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li> Improving web page overall experience
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Having a clear objective for each page
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Including keywords in URL, page titles, content, and meta description
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Adding internal and external links</li>
                                    <li>Keyword rich title tags</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">3. Backlinks</p>
                                <p>Backlinks or inbound links are links from one website that lead to your own to increase your credibility online and rank higher on search engines.</p>
                                <p>We know the importance of being linked to highly relevant and reputable websites.</p>

                                <p>It is possible to do SEO in Geelong by yourself.</p>
                                <p>But, you will need to know the ins and outs of SEO for Geelong businesses.</p>
                                <p>This is extremely time-consuming and definitely not the best use of your time, if you run a company.</p>
                                <p>You could build a team internally that focuses solely on your business’s SEO in Geelong, but the time and costs involved are much higher than working with an agency.</p>
                                <p>The software and tools alone, to develop a strategy for SEO in Geelong, will cost you money.</p>
                                <p>Even if you buy the appropriate software and recruit the right team, they still have to learn about your business and learn to work in harmony. This means that progress will be very slow.</p>
                                <p>An SEO agency in Geelong already has everything in place to start working on your business and attracting your target audience from day one.</p>
                                <p>SEO experts in Geelong come with decades of experience across various industries. This level of experience simply won't be matched by an in-house team or doing SEO on your own.</p>
                                <p>If you want your business to win with SEO in Geelong, you must partner with the best. And there’s no better SEO agency in Geelong than First Page.</p>

							<div itemprop="text" class="card-body">
                                <p>Different businesses have different objectives and require distinct strategies. That is why there is no set cost for SEO services in Geelong.</p>
                                <p>It depends on:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Budget: Different budgets lead to different growth plans for SEO in Geelong.</li>
                                        <li>Scope of work. Different requirements and investments lead to different costs. Depending on where you start from and what you want to achieve going forward, the costs will be more or less.</li>
                                        <li>Desired Results. Different results require varying strategies and investments.</li>
                                        <li>Expertise. The results delivered are proportional to what you invest. Be careful of the temptation of cheap SEO agencies in Geelong. Only the top SEO experts in Geelong offer astute insight, strong market knowledge, and a proven track record of long-term success.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <p>Your chosen SEO agency in Geelong must be up-to-date with the fast-moving SEO market and industry requirements. Cheap SEO companies in Geelong often focus on quantity instead of quality, which can be deadly for your business.</p>
                                <p>Focus on getting a tailor-made plan for your business needs and ensure the practices that are being put in place follow Google's guidelines. You will be surprised how many SEO agencies in Geelong don't.</p>
                                <p>Choosing wrong with your SEO agency in Geelong isn't ideal - and can lead to serious business consequences.</p>

                                <p>SEO in Geelong can be very profitable when it is done properly. Investing in an experienced partner with a proven track record is key to success. So, choose wisely.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO vs White-hat SEO. The cost of SEO agencies in Geelong varies based on which techniques are used to get you results.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO is based on quick wins that don’t last over time. It increases leads by using spam, linking your website to unreputable sources, and manipulates Google's algorithm. When working with providers that use black-hat SEO techniques, you put your business at risk of getting a penalty from Google - or worse... getting banned.</p> 
                                <p>White-hat SEO is a technique that focuses on long-term and sustainable results. It is compliant with the terms and conditions of search engines.</p>
                                <p>Results take longer due to the work required to set it all up. But, it is sustainable.</p>
                                <p>Black-hat SEO in Geelong is cheaper than white-hat for obvious reasons.</p>
                                <p>Before resorting to black-hat SEO in Geelong, ask yourself if the money you save is worth having your website potentially banned from search engines.</p>
                                <p>We don't use black-hat SEO at our SEO agency in Geelong. We are all about transparency, compliance, and achieving incredible results.</p>

								<p>Search Engine Optimisation is organic. This means you don't pay for traffic to your website. SEO specialists in Geelong apply their strategies upfront, in order for your website to rank higher on search engines.</p>
                                <p>Implementation and results take longer than Pay per Click (PPC), but grow over time and are sustainable.</p>
                                <p>This means that once our SEO experts in Geelong have put you on the first page of search engines, you will benefit from a large amount of traffic for years on end.</p>
                                <p>PPC is a paid form of advertising where you are buying traffic to your website. Each time someone clicks on your ad, you pay a fee. Unlike SEO, it requires investment upfront.</p>
                                <p>During a PPC campaign, you are bidding against your competitor for the placement of your ads on Google’s search results for specific keywords.</p>
                                <p>PPC results are instant and highly targeted. However, they only last for the duration of your campaign and have no impact on your website’s performance for organic search results. It works well for online shop owners that have a product to sell or promote.</p>
                                <p>Both PPC and SEO in Geelong can work synergically to significantly boost your traffic. To discover more about our PPC services and how they help you grow your business, click here.</p>

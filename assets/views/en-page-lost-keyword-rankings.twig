                <p>In the world of SEO, there are two main approaches to generate growth – white hat and black hat tactics. The former is focused on using legitimate optimisation techniques that create a productive user experience, while the latter breaks a search engine’s rules to achieve short-term goals. From keyword stuffing to spam and hidden links, using black hat methods will ultimately result in a painful Google penalty.</p>
                <p>At First Page Australia, we only use white hat techniques to deliver SEO success for our clients. Although some companies are tempted to lead an underhanded strategy, this can only damage your business in the long run. Instead, our highly respected team will produce exceptional, keyword-rich content that builds customer loyalty and respect. This way, your business will not only climb the page rankings, but also establish a solid foundation for years to come.</p>

        <h3 class="d-sm-inline-block">Google penalties explained</h3>
        <p class="wide mb-3">With reaching the first page of Google so desirable for every kind of business, many attempt to take SEO shortcuts in an effort to get there faster. Whether this involves over-optimisation or a range of so-called ‘black hat’ tactics, Google’s algorithms are far too clever for this type of approach. In fact, to address these attempts to cheat, Google has implemented a penalty system that can see a website’s rankings crash overnight.</p>
        <p class="wide mb-3">Although these Google penalties can be hugely detrimental to a company’s longevity, it is possible to recover lost page rankings. With the help of an expert team like First Page Australia, we can ensure your business gets back to where it belongs on the SERP. Here, we take a look at the types of penalties that Google can hand down. </p>

                    <h4>Penguin</h4>
                    <p>Building a solid backlink profile is a critical element of <a href="https://firstpage.com.au/seo/">high-quality SEO</a>. This involves having other websites link back to your own website and its content – a process that Google sees as a kind of verification of your authority. However, some people try to boost their website’s rankings by using unnatural links to deceive the algorithms into thinking certain content is more valuable than it truly is.</p>
                    <p>This is why Google created the Penguin penalty – it searches for websites that have been created only to place illegitimate links. With harsh penalties being levied against people running these websites, it takes a lot of work to fix this situation. Fortunately, we have the tools at our disposal to make it happen if a Penguin penalty has been applied to your business.</p>

                    <h4>Possum</h4>
                    <p>The goal behind the development of Possum was to significantly improve local search results. Not only did Google want these types of results to be more diversified, but they also wanted to avoid spam achieving a high rank. This update to the algorithm helped Google reward legitimate businesses that were sought after by customers in their immediate area.</p>
                    <p>However, this seismic shift in the way that Google handled local search results meant that some companies were caught in the crossfire. In fact, research found that up to 64% of local results were impacted by this update. If your business operating in a local context fails to appear in relevant search results, you may have been negatively impacted by Possum.</p>

                    <h4>Panda</h4>
                    <p>Google introduced Panda to give preference to content that it deems as high-quality, while simultaneously reducing the number of poor websites that appear in their search results. With Panda having the potential to dramatically reduce rankings, it’s important to understand what counts as low-quality content.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the main contributor to a Panda penalty is so-called thin content. This is where a web page has very short and basic information with almost the sole intention of ranking for certain keywords. Meanwhile, Panda might also be applied to websites that lack authority and are based around content farming or rudimentary user-generated content.</p>

                    <h4>Hummingbird</h4>
                    <p>The Hummingbird evolution of Google’s algorithm was one of the biggest changes to the search engine that we’ve seen. The update almost fully overhauled how Google interprets a user’s query, with Hummingbird having a much more nuanced understanding of language and conversational tones.</p>
                    <p>Many digital marketers believe this change was implemented due to the rise in voice search. With the way we type compared to our speech featuring a myriad of subtle differences, Hummingbird has helped to resolve many of these issues. If you suspect that this major update to Google’s algorithm has impacted your rankings, our expert team can investigate and find the culprit.</p>
